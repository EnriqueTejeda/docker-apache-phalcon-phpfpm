A docker image  with Apache + Phalcon + PHP-FPM 7.2 all in Alpine Linux with 40MB~ of size :heart:

## Requirements

* Docker Engine  :heart:

### Which programs is inside?

* php-fpm with extensions (gd, mbstring, soap, xml, ctype, json)
* apache2
* apache2-proxy
* libxml2-dev
* libpng-dev
* runit
* libtool

## Why this container execute two process, isn't this a bad practice and goes against docker thinking?

There are many reasons not to think this, however, making this container has been very useful in several cases, such as to run sites that need phalcon and do a very primitive test, feel free to improve it and give me your comments!

## Getting Started

### Run & Enjoy

You only run this command in your terminal:

```
docker run -p HOST_PORT:80 -v YOUR_DIRECTORY:/var/www/localhost/htdocs etejeda/docker-apache-phalcon-phpfpm 
```
And then you only enter to 127.0.0.1 in you navigator & enjoy!

Example: 

```
docker run -p 80:80 -v $PWD/MYFIRSTWEB:/var/www/localhost/htdocs etejeda/docker-apache-phalcon-phpfpm 
```

## Building the container

I provided a makefile for do this job, only run this command:

```
make run build 
```

## Notes

If you require other version of Phalcon or PSR, only run the docker build with the correct args, like:

```
docker build --build-arg PHALCON_VERSION=X.X.X --build-arg PSR_VERSION=X.X.X . -t YOURTAG
```
